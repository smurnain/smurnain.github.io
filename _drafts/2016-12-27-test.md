One of the objectives of this blog is to document key learnings as I study topics that interest me. I'm interested in languages, despite having little natural talent for them. I would like to learn Mandarin Chinese, so I have looked into how to display the four tone markers used in pīnyī e.g. āáǎà.

``` r
a3 <- "&#x1CE;"
i3 <- "&#x1D0;"
hello <- paste0("n",i3," h",a3,"o")
cat(hello)
```

    ## n&#x1D0; h&#x1CE;o

``` r
print(hello)
```

    ## [1] "n&#x1D0; h&#x1CE;o"

In-line output: nǐ hǎo
