One of the objectives of this blog is to document key learnings as I study topics that interest me. I'm interested in languages, despite having little natural talent for them. I would like to learn Mandarin Chinese, so I have looked into   how to display the four tone markers used in p&#299;ny&#299; e.g. &#x101;&#xE1;&#x1CE;&#xE0;.

```{r variables}
a3 <- "&#x1CE;"
i3 <- "&#x1D0;"
hello <- paste0("n",i3," h",a3,"o")
cat(hello)
print(hello)
```

In-line output: `r hello`
