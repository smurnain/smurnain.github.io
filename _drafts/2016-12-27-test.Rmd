One of the objectives of this blog is to document key learnings as I study topics that interest me. I'm interested in languages, despite having little natural talent for them. I would like to learn [Mandarin Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese), so I have looked into   how to display the four tone markers used in [p&#299;ny&#299;n](http://www.pinyin.info/unicode/unicode_test.html) e.g. &#x101;&#xE1;&#x1CE;&#xE0;.

```{r variables}
# define html-friendly unicode characters
a3 <- "&#x1CE;"
i3 <- "&#x1D0;"
# create string for "hello"
hello <- paste0("n",i3," h",a3,"o")
# print
print(hello)
```
Printing the string doesn't work, however in-line output works:  
`r hello`
