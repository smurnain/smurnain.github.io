      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>Armchair Everything is my place for publishing short pieces of writing on topics that interest me. The epithet &amp;lsquo;armchair&amp;rsquo; is usually applied disparaginly to various vocations, e.g. armchair general, armchair traveller. However, I rather like the idea of exploring the world from my armchair.
This website was created using the for the blogdown R package. The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.
I live in Canberra, Australia, and can be contacted via @armchair_writer.</description>
