            <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014</p>

            <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content 
that's supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, images, 
and code are all supported.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>It finally struck him: he was far from Japan, in another country. No matter where he was, he almost always ate alone, so that didn't particularly bother him. But here he wasn't simply alone. He was alone in two senses of the word. He was also a foreigner, the people around him speaking a language he couldn't understand.</p>
			  <p>It was a different sense of isolation from what he normally felt in Japan. And not such a bad feeling, he decided. Being alone in two senses of the word was maybe like a double negation of isolation. In other words, it made perfect sense for him, a foreigner, to feel isolated here. There was nothing odd about it at all. He was in exactly the right place.</p>
