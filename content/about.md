_Armchair Everything_ is my place for publishing short pieces of writing on topics that interest me. The epithet 'armchair' is usually applied disparaginly to various vocations, e.g. armchair general, armchair traveller. However, I rather like the idea of exploring the world from my armchair. 

This website was created using the for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).

I live in Canberra, Australia, and can be contacted via [@armchair_writer](https://twitter.com/armchair_writer).
